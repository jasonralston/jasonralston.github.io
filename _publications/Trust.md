excerpt: 'The stigma attached to any criminal record, including for those found not
guilty, can lead to reduced job prospects and economic hardship long
after judicial proceedings conclude. This paper examines discriminatory
behavior of experimental participants who are given the opportunity to
base an investment or employment decision on their trustee’s/worker’s
criminal record. Similar to the real world, our experiment shows that
employers and investors discriminate against those with criminal
convictions. Surprisingly, we find they also discriminate against those
with acquittals. We find that a subject’s reciprocity corresponds
significantly to the true guilt or innocence of an accused, but not to
conviction or acquittal of a crime. Because reciprocator behavior does not
depend on a person’s criminal record, no rational basis exists for the
observed statistical discrimination against those who have been accused.
Our results raise serious concerns about the practice of using criminal
records in hiring, as convictions are often poor indicators of actual
culpability.'
